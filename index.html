    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Giovanni Cascio. I am an aspiring computer scientist. My dream is to create a stable and realistic ecosystem within a computer. I love the future and I have many hobbies. My favorite things to do are Chess, Video Games, Board Games, and Robotics.</p>
    <h2>My Dream</h2>
    <p>I grew up in a rural town outside of Boise, Idaho. There wasn't much for me to do so I became fascinated with computers. I quickly learned that computers even the playing field when I am competing with my peers.</p>

    <p>As I had much free time, I was able to observe nature and I would speculate how it works. Then one day I had a brilliant idea to create the ultimate combination: Nature inside of a computer. I couldn't see why no one has done this. It's easy, I said to myself. Spoiler Alert: It's not...</p>
    <h2>My Realistic Dream</h2>
    <p>My plan is to attend Boise State University for a Masters Degree in Computer Science. I also have had an endeavor to visit China. For the last four years I have been studying Mandarin Chinese. If it's possible, I will Minor in Chinese Studies.</p>

    <h2>Recently</h2>
    <p>I have been doing a bunch of robotics. My robotics team is currently upgrading our drive system and we are working towards vision autonomy. If you would like to learn more go to my <a href="projects.html">Projects Page</a>. Other than that I have been working towards graduating high school.</p>
